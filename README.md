# Izhikevich model
_Interactive Izhikevich spiking neuron model_

## Launch interactive binder
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jajcayn/izhikevich-model/master?filepath=izhikevich_model.ipynb)

Nothing required, just click on the button, wait a bit till binder builds all that is necessary, and then click `Cell` -> `Run All`. The last cell contains the interactive plot.

## Homemade
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jajcayn/izhikevich-model.git
cd izhikevich-model
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```
and launch `izhikevich_model.ipynb`. Then just `Cell` -> `Run All` and you are done.

Happy modelling!
